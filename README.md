# Slipstream: The Price of Freedom

A mod for Homeworld 2 Classic. Set in the Slipstream universe.

## The _Slipstream_ Universe

_Slipstream_ is an alternative _Homeworld_ universe where the in-game events of _Homeworld_, _Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak_, and _Homeworld: Cataclysm_/_Emergence_, along with the contents of their manuals, are considered canon, while other entries in the franchise, such as _Homeworld 2_, _Homeworld 3_, _Homeworld Mobile_, and other future entries, are **not** considered canon. 

### Introduction

Many years after the events of _Homeworld: Cataclysm/Emergence_, the final remnants of the subversion entity known as The Beast were finally defeated. However, the toll upon the galactic political order was beyond cataclysmic, plunging the galaxy into a long and terrible dark age. With the collapse of the remaining rump states of the Taiidan Empire in the wake of the The Beast, the once heavily patrolled suburbs of the galaxy near the Kashmin Sea and Shamal Clusters have become overrun with Vaygr nomads and other pirate races; in only a few years time, the Vaygr have occupied most of the territory held by the former Taiidan empire. The Vaygr impressed their feudal system onto their conquered territories; those subjugated become vassals, and economically plundered for conquests elsewhere. Those ignored by the Vaygr have turned inward to avoid any attention from pirates or warlords. As for the wise and enigmatic Bentusi, those that didn't flee the galaxy were either consumed by the Beast, or hunted to extinction.

With the Vaygr too busy infighting over the spoils of war, Hiigara, largely unscathed, consolidates its power. Uneager to expand or explore an increasingly hostile galaxy while still struggling to rebuild their lost civilization, the Daiamid decides to pull back to its core territorial possessions around the Homeworld system. With its navy spread thin from its battles with the Beast infection, the consequences of the situation were laid bare: Off-world super capital ship production was a massive security risk versus the effectiveness carrier groups with super capital escorts demonstrated against the Beast infection. It was clear to the Daiamid that mothership class vessels just weren't worth the risk to deploy away from the Homeworld where they could easily be captured or destroyed by the increasingly hostile pirate forces of the galaxy. The Daiamid has instead opted to expand existing planet-side manufacturing on both Hiigara and nearby Hiigaran-controlled planets. 

### _Slipstream Research Initiative_ (SRI)

During the eradication of The Beast, naturally-occurring Slipgates were encountered in the more fringe regions of the galaxy. Further exploration of these areas of the galaxy found artificial Slipgates with striking similarities to Bentusi technology, whom unfortunately were no longer around to explain their operation. However, the other half of the Daiamid's plan involved advancing Hiigaran hyperspace technology so that newly constructed ships could be delivered directly to operational theatres. The _Slipstream Research Initiative_ (SRI) was created to research these slipgates, and if possible, reverse engineer the technology the Bentusi used to harness them. SRI would eventually develop the first generation of Slipstream drives, which are must faster and more efficient than the standard quantum waveform hyperdrive. This technology was kept exclusive to the Hiigarans, who often used it as a bargaining chip, until it was much more beneficial to trade inferior versions of the technology to the Vaygr for access to the former Bentusi regions of the galaxy. 

The Daiamid is not exactly content with this arrangement, and frankly, neither are the various Vaygr warlords who simply want to conquer Hiigara and plunder it for themselves. However, the conquest of Hiigaran space would be extremely resource intensive and would require cooperation among the various factions of Vaygr, whom are constantly warring with each other over territory, and whom also see the Hiigarans as subdued and contained for now. It is SRI's obligation to share any discoveries made within Vaygr territory with them, but the Vaygr know that the Hiigarans do most of the advanced research work deep within their own territory, and have a better chance of reverse-engineering the occasional stray Hiigaran vessel. The benefits of this deal, and the Daiamid's reluctance to challenge the Vaygr directly, have left SRI to operate mostly without oversight deep within the more fringe regions of the galaxy where even the Vaygr do not want to venture.

### The Price of Freedom
This political conundrum has been referred to as "the price of freedom" within the Daiamid chamber; A cold war locking themselves and the Vaygr in a perpetual staring contest until one of them blinks. Until that happens, both factions are under pressure to quickly gather resources and strengthen their forces without the other noticing. This has lead to an extremely tense and lawless borderland between the two factions, where entire fleets go missing in action; of course, destroyed in skirmishes that go completely ignored unless politically convenient. Though, that hasn't stopped the persistent and militarily minded from trying to secure resources and strategic positions in the region without repercussion. This is the true "Price of Freedom": deadlocked political machines fighting an unofficial war with no end in sight... 

## Features

### Multiplayer

When Gearbox re-released Homeworld 2 Classic, they disabled the multiplayer option in the main menu. TPOF restores this option, and allows the player to choose between **Direct Connection** and **Local Area Network (LAN)**; Steam multiplayer is not officially implemented with Homeworld 2 classic, so it has been disabled.

#### Local Area Network (LAN)

LAN multiplayer has been tested with TPOF on both Windows 7 and Windows 11, and is firmly in the "seems to work fine" category, however your mileage may vary. This mode can be also used over the internet via a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel. LAN multiplayer is the preferred connection method to play TPOF. 

#### Direct Connection

Direct Connection multiplayer has not been tested with TPOF. For this method to work on modern networks, the following **UDP** ports need to be forwarded from the local network router or gateway to the machine TPOF is going to be running on: `6073`,`6500`,`13139`, and port range `2302` to `2400`. 

### Gameplay

Though using the same game engine and assets, _Slipstream: The Price of Freedom_ is very different from Homeworld 2. Emphasis on fleet building and long-term strategy has been heavily reduced in favor of fast-paced tactical gameplay with a focus on combat.

#### Hyperspace (Slipstream)

Hiigaran and Vaygr capital ships are now equipped with Slipstream drives that make hyperspace fast and free. Strikecraft and Platforms can now be delivered to the battlefield via ships equipped with a Hyperspace Module.

#### Strikecraft

Strikecraft (Fighters, Corvettes) are faster, more evasive, and break formation often when attacking. Strikecraft are also now capable of being deployed via hyperspace when near a larger ship equipped with a Hyperspace Module subsystem. 

#### Platforms

Platforms can now be moved multiple times, delivered via hyperspace using a module, and also issued guard orders. However, they are slow, weakly armored, and do not engage enemies outside of range. A useful strategy is to have platforms accompany strikecraft when being deployed via hyperspace; Platforms will provide covering fire long enough for strikecraft to get up to speed and scatter.
